# The socket protocol

The daemon's API. The command line, the MCP server and the window are its clients; a desktop
shell or a script integrates Flottille through the command line, which speaks this protocol for
it (`docs/design.md` §3, §11).

## Transport

- One daemon per user listens on the Unix socket `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flottille/daemon.sock`. The
  folder is the user's only (mode 700, owned by the user, checked at every start); a folder open
  to other users is refused.
- The daemon holds an exclusive lock on `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/flottille/daemon.lock`, which holds its
  process id, for its whole life. A second daemon finds the lock taken and refuses to start.
- Any command but `flottille daemon` starts the daemon in the background when nobody listens on
  the socket, then talks to it. The daemon started this way writes its output to
  `$XDG_STATE_HOME/flottille/daemon.log`.

The protocol is written to travel later over an authenticated network transport (design §12):
every request is self-contained, identifiers are opaque strings, and nothing assumes the client
shares the daemon's file system except paths the user typed.

## Framing

Both ways, one JSON object per line (UTF-8, `\n`-terminated, no newline inside an object). A
connection carries any number of requests; answers may come in any order and are matched by id.

### Request (client to daemon)

```json
{"id": "7", "method": "daemon.status", "params": {}}
```

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `id` | A string chosen by the client, opaque to the daemon, unique among its pending requests on the connection. |
| `method` | The method's name. |
| `params` | An object; may be left out when the method takes none. |

### Answer (daemon to client)

```json
{"id": "7", "result": {}}
{"id": "7", "error": {"code": "unknown-method", "message": "unknown method `nope`"}}
```

Exactly one of `result` and `error`. A line that is not a request is answered with an error
without an `id`.

| Error code | |
|---|---|
| `invalid-request` | The line is not a request object. |
| `invalid-params` | The parameters do not fit the method. |
| `unknown-method` | No such method. |
| `unavailable` | The daemon cannot do it now (for example, it is stopping). |

### Event (daemon to client)

```json
{"event": {"seq": 12, "at": 1792843730808, "name": "daemon.started", "data": {}}}
```

Sent only on a connection that subscribed with `events.watch`. The event's fields are in
[`events.md`](events.md).

## Methods

### `daemon.status`

No parameters. The result:

```json
{
  "version": "0.1.0 (dd939a5ec692)",
  "pid": 4242,
  "uptime_s": 192,
  "agents": {"running": 0, "waiting_for_user": 0, "failed": 0}
}
```

`version` is the full version: the release and, for a build from a git checkout, its commit.
`agents` counts the agents running, the root agents waiting for the user, and the agents that
failed.

### `daemon.stop`

No parameters. The result is `{"stopping": true}`; the daemon then emits `daemon.stopping`,
removes its socket, lets the subscribers receive what remains, closes every connection and exits.

### `events.watch`

Subscribes the connection to the event stream.

| Parameter | |
|---|---|
| `after` | Optional event number. With it, the stored events numbered after it are sent first, oldest first, then the new ones. Without it, only the events emitted after the subscription. |

The result is `{"after": <n>}`, the number the stream starts after. It is written before the
first event. Then every event follows, in the order of its number, none missing and none twice,
until the connection closes. A client that lost its connection resumes with the `seq` of the last
event it saw as `after`.
