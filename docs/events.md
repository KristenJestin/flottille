# Events

Every change the daemon makes emits an event. Events are stored, numbered, and streamed to the
subscribers of `events.watch` (`docs/protocol.md`); `flottille watch [--after <n>]` prints them,
one JSON object per line. This file is the contract: an event is added here with the code that
emits it.

## Shape

```json
{"seq": 12, "at": 1792843730808, "name": "daemon.started", "data": {"pid": 4242, "version": "0.1.0"}}
```

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `seq` | The event's number. Grows with every event, across daemon restarts; a number is never given twice. |
| `at` | When it happened, in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. |
| `name` | `<subject>.<what happened>`. |
| `data` | An object, its fields given per event below. A client ignores fields it does not know. |

## The events

### `daemon.started`

The daemon is listening.

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `version` | The daemon's full version. |
| `pid` | Its process id. |

### `daemon.stopping`

The daemon stops: it accepts no new connection and closes the existing ones once their
subscribers have this event.

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `reason` | `request` (`flottille daemon stop`) or `signal` (`SIGTERM`, `SIGINT`). |
