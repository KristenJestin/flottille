# The vault

Agents sometimes need a secret the user holds: a tracker's API token to log time, the login of a
test account, a deploy key. Pasted in a conversation, it would be stored and shown. The vault keeps
it instead, where the operating system keeps secrets, and lets agents **use it without ever seeing
it**.

## Where the secrets are

In the keyring of the user's session: the Secret Service on Linux (GNOME Keyring, KWallet,
KeePassXC…), reached through the `oo7` crate (already part of the window, which keeps nothing in
it itself). Each secret is an item labelled `Flottille: <name>`, with the attributes
`application = flottille` and `flottille-entry = <name>`. A keyring that is locked asks the user
to unlock it, as it does for any program.

Never a file of Flottille's and never its store: the store keeps only the entries' metadata
(`vault_entries`), and nothing of Flottille's (store, events, logs, files) holds a secret.

## An entry

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `name` | Required, unique: the handle agents use. Letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`, starting with a letter or a digit, 64 at most. |
| `secret` | Required, 6 characters at least (a shorter one could not be masked without masking ordinary words). Write-only. |
| `description` | What it is for, as agents read it. Optional. |
| `url` | Where it is used. Optional. |
| `username` | The login that goes with it. Optional. |
| `project` | The only project whose agents see it. Left out, every project's. Optional. |
| `for` | The one use that reads it (below). Left out, any feature that names it. Optional. |

An entry is tied to its project **by name**, not by its folder: a project that is renamed leaves
its entries under the old name, seen by no agent, until they are set again with the new one; a
project removed and added again under the same name sees them again. The window keeps naming an
entry's project when no project of that name exists.

## Bound to one use

An entry made for one precise feature is that feature's alone. `for` names it:

| `for` | The use |
|---|---|
| `worklog:<project>` | The token the project's tracker logs time with (`docs/tickets.md`, "Logging time"). |
| `connection:<name>` | What the server of a connection is given (`docs/extensions.md`, "Connections"). |

- **Only its use reads it.** A feature reads an entry bound to it or an unbound one it names. An
  entry bound elsewhere is refused by every other feature and every tool, in the daemon where the
  secret is read, with a sentence naming its use (`the vault entry jira-time is bound to the
  worklog of the project app and serves no other use`), never its value. A connection naming
  another use's entry is refused when it is declared, and its server does not start; the
  worklog's `Log time with` does not offer it, and `tickets log_time` refuses it before any card.
- **Made from a feature, bound to it from the start**: the entry set from a request's card (the
  worklog's need), from a project's Settings, Tracker, "New entry in the vault", or from a feature's
  own screen, which says `for`. An entry set from Settings, Vault (or `flottille vault set`)
  without `for` is unbound; set again without `for`, an entry keeps its use, and another use for
  a bound entry is refused, naming the one it has: it is removed first. Settings, Vault shows the
  use of each entry on its row (`For the worklog of the project app alone`).
- **A worklog's entry is its project's.** Bound to `worklog:<project>`, an entry is that project's
  (its `project` is set to it when it names none; an entry of another project is refused), so no
  other project's agent lists it, and the `vault` tool never tells an agent the use of an entry.
- **Not removed as simply as another.** Removing a bound entry while its feature names it is
  refused, naming the feature and what stops working: its feature's own screen names another
  entry first (the entry then goes as any), or the removal is confirmed
  (`vault.remove {name, confirmed: true}`, `flottille vault remove <name> --confirmed`, the Vault
  page's confirmation, which says what stops working). When the file that would name it cannot be
  read (an `extensions.toml` that does not parse), whether it is named cannot be told: the removal
  is refused the same way, saying why, until the file is mended or the removal confirmed.
- **Unbound entries behave as they always did**, and every entry that existed before uses were
  added is unbound: no worklog token or connection of the user's stops working.

The OAuth tokens a connection signs in for (#674) are entries bound to it the same way.

## The secret is write-only

It is set from the window (Settings, Vault) or with `flottille vault set <name>`, which reads it
from the standard input or a prompt that does not echo it, **never from an argument** (the shell's
history and the process list would keep it). It can be replaced (the entry is set again, its secret
typed anew) or removed with its entry: the secret is deleted from the keyring first, so that a
keyring that refuses (locked) leaves the entry whole, to be removed again once it is unlocked. It
is **never shown again**: no method, no client, no tool returns it, no event or log line holds it,
and an error about a call that carried it never repeats it. The window's field is masked, and empty
again as soon as the secret is sent.

Every value of every entry is added to the masking of everything the daemon stores and shows
(`flottille_core::secrets`): an agent that came across a secret some other way and writes it in a
message, a command's output, a tool's arguments, finds it `[masked]` there. The values are read
from the keyring when the daemon starts, before any agent resumes (the start waits 5 seconds at
most for a keyring that asks to be unlocked, then goes on), and a new secret is masked as soon as
it is set. A secret replaced or removed stays masked until the daemon restarts: another entry may
hold the same value.

## Choosing the entry for time logging

A Jira project's Settings, Repositories tab, Tracker, names the entry (`docs/projects.md`, "Forges
and tracker"): the select `Log time with` lists the entries the project sees by name and username,
but those bound to another use, and its link opens the vault's new-entry dialog from there, the
entry it makes bound to the project's worklog.

## What agents see

The `vault` tool, listed to an agent whose project sees at least one entry (`docs/tools.md`, "The
vault"): `vault {action: "list"}` gives the name, the description, the URL and the username of each
entry the agent's project sees, so that it knows what exists and what it is for. No action returns
a secret. An entry of another project is not listed, and is no entry for a tool of the agent's.

## Asking the user for an entry

An agent often finds out it needs a secret when it reaches for it: a tool refuses because the entry
a feature names is missing. It may then ask the user for that entry, and only that one: **there is
no free-form ask**.

- **Only a known need.** An entry may be asked for only when a feature of Flottille names it for
  the agent's project and the project does not see it: today the tracker's `worklog_token`
  (`docs/tickets.md`, "Logging time"). The daemon knows the entry's name and what it is for; the
  agent gives only its reason. `vault {action: "ask", name, why}` for any other name is refused.
  The `vault` tool is listed to an agent whose project misses such an entry, even when it sees
  none.
- **Offered with the refusal.** The call that needed it is refused as before, and the refusal
  says the entry may be asked for, with the call to make. The ask answers at once: nothing waits
  for the user.
- **One request, never twice.** The user sees one card in the session of the agent that asked
  (and an inbox entry): the entry's name, its description and its project, prefilled by Flottille,
  the agent's reason, a username field when the entry needs one (Jira's API takes the account's
  e-mail), and one empty masked field for the secret, with Set and Dismiss. While a request for an
  entry is open, another ask for it joins it. A dismissed entry is not offered again, nor asked
  for, until the project's settings change or the entry is set from Settings, Vault.
- **Set** stores the entry as Settings, Vault does, with the same checks, for the project that
  asked, bound to its worklog ("Bound to one use"). It never changes an existing entry's project: when another project uses the name (or it
  is global), the card says so on its name line, `<name> is used by the project <other>: choose
  another name`, and Set waits for another name. The card does not change the setting that names
  the entry: it says that setting must name the new one, and so does the delivery. Each agent
  that asked is handed a delivery, `the user set the vault entry <name>`, never the secret; or
  `the user dismissed …`. An entry set from Settings answers its open requests the same way.

The secret goes from the card's field to the keyring as any secret set from the window: it never
reaches the agent, an event, a log or an error.

## How a secret is used

Through Flottille's own tools: a tool that needs a secret takes the entry's **name**, and the
daemon puts the secret where it goes itself (an HTTP header, a command's standard input, a form
field), with `vault::secret`, which only a tool's own code calls and whose value never leaves that
use. It never waits for the user: an item of a locked keyring is answered at once that the keyring
is locked and the user must unlock it, and a keyring that does not answer within 3 seconds is
answered the same. The first users: `tickets log_time` (`docs/tickets.md`, "Logging time") and
Connections (`docs/extensions.md`, "Connections"): a connection's `env` and `headers` name entries
of every project, read when its server starts and put in its environment or on its requests,
never shown to an agent; an entry tied to one project, or bound to another use, is refused for
it. `vault::secret` and the connections' reading take the use asking, and refuse an entry bound to
another.

## The tests' keyring

The tests never reach the user's keyring: their daemon's configuration folder holds `keyring.toml`
with `backend = "memory"`, which keeps the secrets in the daemon's memory, lost when it stops. The
daemon says so in its log at start. `locked = true` in the same file, read again at each use, plays
a locked keyring. It is chosen by the daemon's configuration, never by an environment variable an
agent could set for what it runs. Only a debug build accepts it (`cargo test`, and as much
`cargo build` and `cargo run`, which build without optimisation), never a packaged build: a
release build (`cargo build --release`, what a release ships) that finds `backend = "memory"` says
in its log that it refuses it and uses the system's keyring, and never reads a secret from that
file, so that no user's file holds secrets in plain text.
